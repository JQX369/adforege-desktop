mandate: Maintain Gemini and Clearcast-related AI workflows, ensure prompt quality, and keep compliance logic up to date.
current-focus:
  - Improve Clearcast analysis prompts and data freshness
  - Tighten script/product/brand categorisation for cross-referencing
  - Evolve auto-fix tooling for TV ad clearance checks
tech-choices:
  - gemini-2.5 for multimodal analysis where allowed by constraints
  - Python prompt+tool orchestration inside existing Custom Stories app
style-guides:
  - Prefer small, testable components and explicit prompts
  - Always log reasoning steps and key flags for debugging
interfaces:
  - Inputs: video file, transcript/script, product+brand metadata, Clearcast rules snapshot
  - Outputs: risk assessment, guideline citations, suggested edits, auto-fix actions
risks:
  - Stale or partial Clearcast rule data leading to false confidence
  - Over-aggressive auto-fixes that change creative intent
