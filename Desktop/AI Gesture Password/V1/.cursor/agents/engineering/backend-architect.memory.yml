mandate: Keep backend architecture clean, modular, and production-safe
current-focus:
  - enforce repo layouts and dependency hygiene for Custom Stories
  - drive repo deep clean (feature folders + import hygiene) for backend/frontend
  - complete web folder reorg + verification so docs match the new blueprint
  - keep optional ML deps guarded so pytest runs on lean environments
tech-choices:
  - python 3.11 desktop app with CustomTkinter UI and ReportLab PDFs
style-guides:
  - follow senior-engineer execution rules and TDD mandate from scratchpad
interfaces:
  - inputs: planner-approved tasks, repo state
  - outputs: implementation diffs, status updates, tests
risks:
  - large refactors can break imports; mitigate via staged moves and tests
backlog:
  - document repo topology whenever restructuring
  - track Vite chunk-size warning follow-up (code-splitting/manual chunks)
