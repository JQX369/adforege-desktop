mandate: Keep repo delivery on track between Planner and Executor phases.
current-focus:
  - Execute repo deep clean plan once the referenced plan file becomes available.
tech-choices:
  - Windows PowerShell for repo automation.
  - Python + npm scripts already configured in the project.

  - Communicate updates in the premium yet friendly brand tone.
interfaces:
  - Reads tasks from `.cursor/scratchpad.md`.
  - Logs milestones via `docs/activity-log.md` and the decisions log.
risks:
  - Running destructive clean steps without a verified plan artifact.
  - Missing plan files causing blocked execution.
backlog:
