2025-11-14 • [frontend-developer] • Custom Stories PDF layout refinement • Standardised PDF titles, fixed card HTML rendering by using Paragraph cells, reduced unnecessary page breaks, added section divider, and introduced layout configs plus layout docs. • app/pdf_generator.py, docs/guides/custom_stories_pdf_layout.md, tests/test_pdf_generator_utils.py
2025-11-14 • [frontend-developer] • Creative PDF spacing + persona refresh • Added AI disclaimers, tightened spacing constants, refreshed benchmark conversion copy, and expanded simulated audience personas with smarter keep-together logic while keeping tests green. • app/pdf_generator.py, app/effectiveness_benchmarks.py, tests/
2025-11-15 • [ai-engineer] • Clearcast analysis & fixing planning • Defined roadmap to improve Clearcast rules ingestion, script/product/brand categorisation, and auto-fix tooling (audio, clock, countdown) for TV ad clearance. • .cursor/scratchpad.md, src/app/clearcast_checker.py, src/app/clearcast_updater.py, tests/
2025-11-15 • [ai-engineer] • Clearcast snapshot + updater refresh • Added typed rule snapshot models, seeded `clearcast_updates.json` with structured data, refreshed the updater to manage versions/timestamps, and surfaced “last updated” messaging in the UI with regression tests. • src/app/clearcast_rules.py, src/app/clearcast_updates.json, src/app/clearcast_updater.py, src/app/video_analyzer_gui.py, tests/
2025-11-15 • [ai-engineer] • Clearcast prompt + reasoning upgrade • Introduced prompt builder + context model, updated checker to load rule snapshots, support verbose reasoning, and normalise structured responses; added targeted tests. • src/app/clearcast_prompt_builder.py, src/app/clearcast_checker.py, tests/test_clearcast_prompt_builder.py, tests/test_clearcast_response_parser.py
2025-11-15 • [ai-engineer] • Clearcast classification cross-reference • Hooked classifier outputs into the compliance flow, added focus summaries/disclaimers to results, and surfaced the new “Classification Snapshot” section in both UI and PDF. • src/app/clearcast_checker.py, src/app/clearcast_classifier.py, src/app/video_analyzer_gui.py, src/app/pdf_generator.py, tests/
2025-11-15 • [ai-engineer] • Audio readiness stub • Added FFmpeg-backed audio normalization analyzer, blue-flag integration, and UI/PDF “Audio Readiness” surfaces plus guardrails-aware polish options. • src/app/clearcast_audio.py, src/app/clearcast_checker.py, src/app/video_analyzer_gui.py, src/app/pdf_generator.py, tests/test_clearcast_audio.py, tests/test_pdf_generator_utils.py
2025-11-15 • [ai-engineer] • Clearcast e2e regression coverage • Created deterministic end-to-end Clearcast test harness, strengthened checker logging/metadata assignment, and ensured rules snapshots/classifications overwrite defaults for reliable downstream rendering. • tests/test_clearcast_end_to_end.py, src/app/clearcast_checker.py
