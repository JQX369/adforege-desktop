Script 1 and 2 are tonally dissonant (industrial/surreal) and carry unacceptable compliance risks. We will pivot Script 3's concept of 'difficult communication' to symbolize the struggle of connecting with a distracted child, positioning the personalized book as the breakthrough solution.",

The 'struggle' to communicate should feel relatable and slightly comedic, not frustrating. 4) Product: The book must look physically high-quality\u2014focus on the texture of the paper and the child's name to ground the 'forever keepsake' angle."
