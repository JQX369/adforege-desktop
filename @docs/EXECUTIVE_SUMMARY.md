## THE HONEST ASSESSMENT

**You're 80% there.** 

The hard engineering work is done. The product is solid. The UI is beautiful. The business model makes sense.

**But without products, it's a beautiful empty shell.**

The good news? Adding products is the *easiest* part. No complex coding. Just data entry or API calls.

**You can launch THIS WEEK if you commit to the sprint.**

The question is: **Are you ready to finish this?**
