# Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Improve semi-broken search to increase relevance, CTR, and conversion for gifting.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Sparse/heterogeneous data; long-tail queries; intent ambiguity
- Cold-start and freshness for gift inventory
- Balancing performance and cost; vendor lock-in risks

## High-level Task Breakdown
- Define KPIs and baseline (Recall@K, CTR, add-to-cart rate)
- Instrument query telemetry and zero-results logging
- Prototype Option A (with APIs) behind flag; A/B test
- Prototype Option B (no external APIs) behind flag; A/B test
- Choose path; productionize; rollback plan

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Create plan (two options)
- [ ] Instrument telemetry
- [ ] Build Option A prototype
- [ ] Build Option B prototype
- [ ] A/B test and decide

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Initial planning underway

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Pending product KPIs and constraints on external APIs

## Lessons
- TBD
